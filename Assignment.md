Please feel free to ask us questions.

Either you will be provided a Github repo or please create your own, named `BE_comments_<YOUR_NAME>`, download this gist and include the files to the repo. Create a README.md file with simple instructions to run it.

The focus of this assignment is on the **back end** (or **server side**) with a small portion of **front end**. We will be looking specifically for good practices and your development process.

It is recommended to use **Node.js with either Express.js or Koa.js** as frameworks. Alternatively, feel free to use **GoLang**.

Also, use **MongoDB** or **Postgres** for this assignment. All the languages refered have libraries and drivers for these DBs.

## Fictional MVP!

This fictional client has asked for a comment system for his Reddit style online forum. Feel free to checkout Reddit or Hacker News to get a general idea of what is desired.
They would like you to design a system that can be attach to an online forum.

The model/architecture design is up to you

### Front End

The front end should be one page with html/css/js that is able to create new comments, reply to comments, and upvote comments(as well as show the number of points the comment has)

#### make it run!

In the README, along with instructions to run the server should be some sample input.

#### hints
- don't wory about authentication/users, just make up user names, or hardcode user objects.
- there isn't one right answer, but the modeling skills matters
- also, don't worry about finding a perfect solution to this, it's a MVP
- make simple instructions to execute the server
